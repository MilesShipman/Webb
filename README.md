# Webb Terminal


The idea behind Webb as to create a Python driven terminal emulators.  Currently much of the back ground is in place to maintain multiple terminal sessions at one time.  

Currently the program is limited by the a failure to over write the python input function.  I can pull info from the terminal window but only if it occurs rapidly, one the program has to wait the input function fails. 


Still unsure of the implementation of UNIX commands, the options consist of rewriting them in Python or utilizing the UNIX commands build into linux/converting unix into ms commands.

Massive TODO:  Need to fix the input issues.
